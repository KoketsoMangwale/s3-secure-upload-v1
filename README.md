# üîê Secure Serverless Document Upload System

This project is a fully serverless, token-based file upload system built on AWS. It allows clients to **securely upload sensitive documents via a unique, anonymous link**, using **presigned S3 URLs**. Ideal for healthtech, fintech, legal tech, and other privacy-sensitive applications.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

‚úÖ Anonymous, secure document uploads  
‚úÖ One-time tokens mapped to client IDs  
‚úÖ Mobile-friendly ‚Äî no login required  
‚úÖ Files go **directly to S3** via presigned URLs  
‚úÖ Upload metadata (file name, type, timestamp) is logged  
‚úÖ GDPR-compliant: HTTPS-only, encrypted S3 storage, and no PII in URLs

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/s3-secure-upload-v1.git
   cd s3-secure-upload-v1
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:

## üß™ API Endpoints

### 1. Generate Upload Token

```
curl -X POST https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/generate-token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"client_id": "ABC123"}'
```

```
Response:
{
"token": "224DB687",
"upload_url": "/upload-url/224DB687",
"expires_at": "2025-08-12T15:25:46.203808"
}
```
---

s3-secure-uploadPresignedURL Policy (executionRole)
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Statement1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:GetItem",
                "dynamodb:PutItem",
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:dynamodb:af-south-1:XXXXXXXXXXXX:table/SecureUploadTokens",
                "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:XXXXXXXXXXXX:table/SecureUploadLogs"
                "arn:aws:s3:::secure-upload-bucket-kbm/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### 2. Get Presigned Upload URL
From the response in step 1. Replace the token in the endpoint below
```
curl https://mhiinugqqd.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/upload-url/{token}
```
Response:

```
(
"upload_url": `Presigned URL`
"filename": "3cfa01a2bbab42249161187fd18a7047.bin", 
"key": "uploads/3cfa01a2bbab42249161187fd18a7047.bin", 
"content_type": "application/octet-stream"
}
```
---

### 3. Upload File (Client uses returned URL)
Using the `Presigned URL` from the response of the previous GET request, go to a browser, paste the URL 
```
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" -T myfile.txt `Presigned URL`

```

---

### 4. Confirm Upload

```
curl -X POST https://mhiinugqqd.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/upload/confirm/224DB687 \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"filename": "3cfa01a2bbab42249161187fd18a7047.bin", "content_type": "application/octet-stream"}'
```
Response:

`{"message": "Upload confirmed"}`

---
